## üìù **Files Created (Need Implementation)**

The following stub files have been created and need implementation:

### Method Files (crates/wallet-core/src/methods/):
1. ‚ùó `hmac_operations.rs` - Empty stub (needs ~237 lines)
2. ‚ùó `signature_operations.rs` - Empty stub (needs ~340 lines)
3. ‚ùó `key_linkage.rs` - Empty stub (needs ~245 lines)
4. ‚ùó `blockchain_queries.rs` - Empty stub (needs ~88 lines)
5. ‚ùó `output_management.rs` - Empty stub (needs ~44 lines)

---

## üéØ **Quick Action Plan**

### Option 1: Full Restoration (Recommended)
I can restore all method files with full implementations now. This will take about 5-7 more messages but will give you:
- Complete HMAC operations
- Complete signature operations
- Complete key linkage (BRC-42)
- Blockchain queries
- Output management

### Option 2: Minimal Stubs
I can add minimal stub implementations that return errors, allowing the code to compile immediately. You can implement them later.

### Option 3: Staged Restoration
Restore files in priority order:
1. First: hmac_operations + signature_operations (most critical)
2. Second: key_linkage (BRC-42)
3. Third: blockchain_queries + output_management
4. Fourth: WAB client (optional)
5. Fifth: MySQL storage (optional feature)

## üîç **What About the Other Files?**

### WAB Client Files
The WAB client was **fully functional** but got reverted to stubs. Since it's in a separate crate (`wallet-wab-client`), it can work with basic stubs for now.

**Current state**:
- Basic trait definitions exist
- Full implementation was deleted
- Not critical for wallet-core compilation

### MySQL Storage
The MySQL storage was an **optional feature** (`mysql` feature flag). Since you deleted it:
- The `storage_mysql.rs` file is gone
- The feature still works (just no MySQL backend)
- SQLite storage still works fine
- Can be re-added later if needed

### Documentation Files
All documentation (COMPLETION_REPORT.md, QUICKSTART.md, etc.) was deleted. These can be recreated anytime and don't affect functionality.

---

## ‚ö° **Immediate Next Steps**

**Shall I proceed to restore the 5 method files with full implementations?**

This will:
‚úÖ Make the code compile
‚úÖ Restore HMAC operations  
‚úÖ Restore signature operations
‚úÖ Restore key linkage (BRC-42)
‚úÖ Restore blockchain queries
‚úÖ Restore output management

Total time: ~5-7 messages
Total lines: ~950 lines of code

**Reply "yes" or "restore" and I'll proceed immediately!**

Or tell me which specific files you want restored first.
